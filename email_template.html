    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>

    <p>
      How have you been? I miss you! It's been, like, <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and I'm loving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Take a look at my most recent posts:
      <ul>
        <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
           <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
        <% } %>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for reading. Take care!
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk to you soon,<br>
